This project explores the application of Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques to develop an automated stock trading strategy. The goal is to train an agent that can make informed buy, sell, or hold decisions based on historical stock price data, maximizing long-term profits.

Features
*Data Preprocessing: Extract and clean historical stock data for model training.
*Reinforcement Learning Model: Implement and train various RL algorithmsto optimize trading strategies.
*Performance Evaluation: Analyze and visualize the performance of the trained models.
*Backtesting: Simulate the trading strategy on historical data to evaluate its effectiveness.
